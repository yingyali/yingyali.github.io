**About Me** <br />
I am currently a postdoc research fellow in the [Computational Health Informatics Program (CHIP)](https://www.chip.org/) at Harvard Medical School and Boston Children's Hospital with [Dr. Guergana Savova](https://research.childrenshospital.org/guergana_k_savova/). Before my current position, I obtained my Ph.D. in Information Science and Technology from the School of Information Studies at Syracuse University, advised by [Dr. Bei Yu](https://ischool.syr.edu/bei-yu/). My research broadly fits in natural language processing and its application to clinical narratives and scientific research output. My work has been published in health informatics journals such as JAMIA, JBI, JACI and NLP conferences such as ACL, EMNLP, NAACL, and COLING.
